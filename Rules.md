# BASIC RULES

## Unit Characteristics
 
**Movement (M)**  
How far the warrior can move in inches.

**Weapon Skill (WS)**  
The warrior’s ability to hit in close combat.

**Ballistic Skill (BS)**  
The warrior’s ability to hit with missile weapons.

**Strength (S)**  
How hard the warrior hits in close combat.

**Toughness (T)**  
How resilient the warrior is and his ability to withstand blows.

**Wounds (W)**  
How many times the warrior can be wounded before going out of action.

**Initiative (I)**  
How fast the warrior strikes in close combat, how good he is at climbing buildings, and how alert he is to the presence of hidden enemies.

**Attacks (A)**  
How many blows the warrior can land in a single round of close combat.

**Leadership (Ld)**  
How brave and courageous the warrior is.

**Characteristics Tests**  
When the rules refer to a characteristics test, such as a “Strength test,” an “Initiative test” and so on, this is the way to test it:

* Roll a D6: If the result is equal to, or lower than the warrior’s characteristic, the test is passed. Otherwise it is failed.
* A natural 1 always succeeds and a natural 6 always fails, regardless of the warrior’s characteristic.
* *(Leadership is tested on 2D6, see below.)*

**Maximum and Minimum Characteristics**  
Characteristics may be increased to any level, but cannot be reduced below 1.

**Leadership Tests**  
When taking a Leadership test, roll 2D6: If the result is equal to, or lower than the warrior’s Leadership characteristic, the test is passed. Otherwise it is failed.

**Armour Save (AS)**  
How effective the warrior’s armour is at protecting him. When the warrior is hit by an attack, roll a D6: If the result is equal to, or higher than, the warrior’s AS value, the armour has protected the warrior against the attack and the hit is forfeited. Otherwise, the armour has failed to protect.

**Armour Piercing (AP)**  
The Strength of incoming attacks can pierce a warrior’s armour as follows:

| S  | 1-3 | 4  | 5  | 6  | 7  | 8  | 9  | 10 |
|----|-----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|
| AS | -   | -1 | -2 | -3 | -4 | -5 | -6 | -7 |

Note that armour piercing effects are temporary and only applies to individual attacks whereas armour splintering effects lasts for the rest of the battle.

**Armour Splintering**  
Armour that successfully protects against a hit splinters by one point. (E.g. if a warrior has a 5+ armour save and his armour protects against a hit, he now has a 6+ armour save instead.)

* Armour Splintering effects last until the end of the battle. (I.e. all armour will be restored to its full AS after the battle.)
* A warrior’s Armour Save can be completely negated by splintering effects.

**Out of Action**  
A warrior that loses his last wound is considered out of action. He is removed from the board and must roll for injuries after the battle.

**Measuring Distances Beforehand**  
In WyrdWars you may always measure all distances before deciding whether to take a given action.
